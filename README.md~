Panopticon
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Panopticon is (or rather, will be) a pure functional Audio/Graphics/Networking Language written in C++ and aimed at creative projects. The language itself only requires GCC 4.7 or higher with C++11 enabled. We have yet to compile with LLVM/Clang, but this should theoretically work. The IDE requires Qt 5 or higher, but this is optional. As it stands the language is seeing heavy development and is so slowly approaching an alpha. In its current state Panopticon is not useable, however development is continued and consistent. 

Notable features include higher order functions, dynamic scoping, immutable objects, and lazy evaluation of everything (everything such as variables, arrays, and dictionaries are really just functions, and all functions are lazily evaluated). Most of the basics of the language have been implemented, but the graphics and audio libraries have yet to be written. Most likely audio will use PortAudio and we will roll our own graphics library, heavily influenced by Cinder and other similar projects, albeit it very light weight. At the moment it's still very unstable, but hopefully in the relative near future a stable alpha will be made available.

We should note that the language takes heavy influence from languages and libraries such as SuperCollider, Haskell, Lisp, Cinder, Open Frameworks, ChucK, Processing, and many more. These are all wonderful languages and projects and would highly recommend their use for creative projects.
