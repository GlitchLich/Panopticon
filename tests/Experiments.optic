// Just some fun experimentation, none of this actually does anything yet

// Lattices
// A lattice a structure where each element in it has a meet (greatest lower bound) and join (least upper bound

// We want infinite lazy lattices, something I haven't seen before. Ive read about finite, but not infinite

// How they work: 
// The simples form of lattice structures are boolean lattices, on/off, true/false, join/meet
// More complicated would be doubles

Lattice x y op = op( x y )
	where 
		bottom = false
		top = true
		meet = x && y
		join = x || y

// Lattice as a product of two lattices
Lattices x y op = op( x y )
	where
		bottom = [ bottom bottom ]
		top = [ top top ] 
		meet x y u v = [ meet(x y) meet(u v) ]
		join x y u v = [ join(x y) join(u v) ]
